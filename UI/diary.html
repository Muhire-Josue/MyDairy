                <p>I would like to tell u some flat story about my class. Do u konw that ?
                    we 've got a so called "class flower" in front of me by several rows.
                    i have to admit that she is some kind of a beauty .But i don't interested in and appreciate her at
                    all ,for one reason importantly is i've already got a GF (although i don't think this emotion
                    between us can last for ever or long ,but i have to try ..), for the other reason ,i don't think
                    those girls are not vulgar badly .In fact ,nowadays ,more and more girls' <br>
                    Several days before is Mid-Autumn Day , so i hope this festival doesn't lose it's own meaning . In
                    Song Dynasty a poet named SUSHI expressed his emotion by saying " I wish everyone could live a long
                    life and get together by heart no matter how far they were ".
                    But today , with the destory of growing technology, human-beings are losing their touch with wild
                    nature , they are losing their sense of beauty ,and they are even losing their living sense on this
                    earth , why are we born to this world.
