                    <p>i would like to tell u some flat story about my class. Do u konw that ?
                        we 've got a so called "class flower" in front of me by several rows.
                        i have to admit that she is some kind of a beauty .But i don't interested in and appreciate her
                        at
                        all ,for one reason importantly is i've already got a GF (although i don't think this emotion
                        between us can last for ever or long ,but i have to try ..), for the other reason ,i don't think

                        In
                        Song Dynasty a poet named SUSHI expressed his emotion by saying " I wish everyone could live a

                    <p>Today i got a new recognization of education in China which is on behalf of the same educational
                        system in Asian (yeah i believe that a new recognization everyday makes me a more ripe and
                        optimistic person) In Asian ,especially in China ,students don't and can't have the courage and
                        good
                        conditions to reach their knowledge by their own .The reason i think is not only because they
                        are
                        lazy but more importantly because the surroundings make most of them to be a more negative
                        people ,
                        which i've been against all the time.

                        "we

                        is that right? in my opinion, it is no democracy if the national benefits are based on most

                        GOD won't let human lose all hopes easily. In my opinion , there still are some effective

                        for this certainly unfair condition.
